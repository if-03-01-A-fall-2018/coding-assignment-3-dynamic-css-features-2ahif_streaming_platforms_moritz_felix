      <h1>What Is On-Demand-Streaming</h1>
          On-demand streaming transfers data stored on a server over the network to a client.
          The client can pause, fast-forward, and rewind playback.
          The data is pre-stored on the client side in a media buffer.
          The client can start the stream while data is being transferred or
          before the entire file has been transferred. Playback delay plays a role here,
          which means that control commands should be executed within 1 to 10 seconds.

          <h2>Different Variants: </h2>
          <dt><h3>Download-to-rent</h3></dt>
            <dd>Download to rent is a form of streaming on demand. You can buy the content
              for a limited amount of time. After this time ends the content is not avaliable
              any more. For example Amazon Video provides download to rent and download to own.</dd>
          <dt><h3>Download-to-Own</h3></dt>
            <dd>With the variant Download-to-Own (DTO) the users get an unlimited right of use and
              can archive it. Ownership of the content remains with the copyright owner despite the
              misleading name. This is the much rarer usage. In professional circles, this variant
              is also called electronic sell-through (EST).Providers for Download-to-Own are : Videoload,
               iTunes Store, Anixe and Viewster. </dd>
          <dt><h3>Kino-on-Demand</h3></dt>
            <dd>Cinema-on-Demand is a variation of the popular Video-on-Demand system. With one major difference:
               Cinemas can also earn money from digital distribution in the future. Thus, they generate additional
               income to counteract the declining cinema development. There are different variants. On the one hand,
               the cinemas can provide their own sub-service on their homepages and thus participate in the income
               from online distribution. On the other hand, platforms are being created in Germany where the
               registration and the postcode included will evaluate the cinema-on-demand functionality: If the
               user sees a movie on this platform, their postcode will be evaluated and the cinema in their post
               code Area, gets a percentage of the revenue. In return, the cinemas advertise this platform before
               each of their films. This creates a broad reach that also benefits filmmakers.Cinema-on-demand in
               the backbone has nothing to do with day-and-date launches (simultaneous launch of films online and
               in the cinema), but works on it. </dd>
               <dt><h3>Subscription-Video-on-Demand</h3></dt>
                 <dd>Subscription-Video-on-Demand (SVOD) is a variant of Video-on-Demand where
                   the user can stream video through a monthly or annual subscription. Video
                   streaming requires broadband internet access. An internet tariff with unlimited
                   data volume (data flat rate) is advantageous due to the high volume of data.
                   Well-known providers are Netflix, Amazon Video, Crunchyroll or Maxdome.</dd>
