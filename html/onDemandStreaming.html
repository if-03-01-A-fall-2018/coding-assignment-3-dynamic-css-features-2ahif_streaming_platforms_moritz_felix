        <h1>What Is On-Demand-Streaming</h1>
            On-demand streaming transfers data stored on a server over the network to a client.
            The client can pause, fast-forward, and rewind playback.
            The data is pre-stored on the client side in a media buffer.
            The client can start the stream while data is being transferred or
            before the entire file has been transferred. Playback delay plays a role here,
            which means that control commands should be executed within 1 to 10 seconds.

            <h2>Different Variants: </h2>
            <dt><h3>Download-to-rent</h3></dt>
              <dd>Download to rent is a form of streaming on demand. You can buy the content
                for a limited amount of time. After this time ends the content is not avaliable
                any more. For example Amazon Video provides download to rent and download to own.</dd>
            <dt><h3>Download-to-Own</h3></dt>
              <dd>With the variant Download-to-Own (DTO) the users get an unlimited right of use and
                can archive it. Ownership of the content remains with the copyright owner despite the
                misleading name. This is the much rarer usage. In professional circles, this variant
                is also called electronic sell-through (EST).Providers for Download-to-Own are : Videoload,
                 iTunes Store, Anixe and Viewster. </dd>
            <dt><h3>Kino-on-Demand</h3></dt>
              <dd>Cinema-on-Demand is a variation of the popular Video-on-Demand system. With one major difference:
                 Cinemas can also earn money from digital distribution in the future. Thus, they generate additional
                 income to counteract the declining cinema development. There are different variants. On the one hand,
                 the cinemas can provide their own sub-service on their homepages and thus participate in the income
                 from online distribution. On the other hand, platforms are being created in Germany where the
                 registration and the postcode included will evaluate the cinema-on-demand functionality: If the
                 user sees a movie on this platform, their postcode will be evaluated and the cinema in their post
                 code Area, gets a percentage of the revenue. In return, the cinemas advertise this platform before
                 each of their films. This creates a broad reach that also benefits filmmakers.Cinema-on-demand in
                 the backbone has nothing to do with day-and-date launches (simultaneous launch of films online and
                 in the cinema), but works on it. </dd>
                 <dt><h3>Subscription-Video-on-Demand</h3></dt>
                   <dd>Subscription-Video-on-Demand (SVOD) is a variant of Video-on-Demand where
                     the user can stream video through a monthly or annual subscription. Video
                     streaming requires broadband internet access. An internet tariff with unlimited
                     data volume (data flat rate) is advantageous due to the high volume of data.
                     Well-known providers are Netflix, Amazon Video, Crunchyroll or Maxdome.</dd>
