<h1>What Is Live Streaming</h1>
Live streaming is a streaming media offering (video or audio) provided in real time.
The signal is often digitally converted by means of an encoder software and can
be transmitted via a digital transmission channel. Depending on the
degree of compression and transmission quality different streaming codecs are used.
Live streaming is not synonymous with the transmission of live webcam images on a web page.
In the case of the latter, a still image, for example a webcam, is loaded onto a web server
via FTP only at a certain distance.In contrast to live streaming is the on-demand streaming.
Live stream services encompass a wide variety of topics, from social media to video games.
Apps such as Facebook Live, Periscope, and 17 include the streaming of scheduled promotions
and celebrity events as well as streaming between users, as in videotelephony. Sites such
as Twitch.tv have become popular outlets for watching people play video games, such as in
eSports, Let's Play-style gaming, or speedrunning.User interaction via chat rooms forms a
major component of live streaming. Platforms often include the ability to talk to the broadcaster
or participate in conversations in chat. An extreme example of viewer interfacing is the
social experiment Twitch Plays Pokémon, where viewers collaborate to complete Pokémon games
by typing in commands that correspond to controller inputs.

<h2>Different Types Of Live Streaming Services</h2>
<dt><h3>Twitch.tv</h3></dt>
  <dd>Twitch is a live streaming video platform owned by Twitch Interactive, a subsidiary of Amazon.
     Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform, Justin.tv,
     the site primarily focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of eSports competitions, in
     addition to music broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams. Content on the
     site can be viewed either live or via video on demand.The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of its
     general-interest counterpart. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers, and by
     February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States.
      At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Twitch Interactive to represent the shift
      in focus – Justin.tv was shut down in August 2014. That month, the service was acquired by Amazon for
      US$970 million, which later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's subscription service
      Amazon Prime. Twitch later acquired Curse, an operator of online video gaming communities and introduced
      means to purchase games through links on streams along with a program allowing streamers to receive
      commissions on the sales of games that they play.By 2015, Twitch had more than 1.5 million broadcasters
       and 100 million viewers per month. As of Q3 2017, Twitch remained the leading live streaming video
       service for video games in the US, and had an advantage over YouTube Gaming. As of May 2018, it
       had 2.2 million broadcasters monthly and 15 million daily active users, with around a million average concurrent users.</dd>
<dt><h3>DAZN</h3></dt>
  <dd>In July 2017, DAZN announced that it would expand into Canada, after having acquired OTT streaming rights to
    the National Football League in Canada, including NFL Game Pass and access to NFL RedZone; as a result of the
    deal, television providers would no longer sell the out-of-market sports package NFL Sunday Ticket to residential
     customers. The DAZN deal does not affect the NFL's newly-extended linear television rights deal with Bell Media.
      On 8 August 2017, DAZN reached a deal to sublicense content from beIN Sports Canada, including selected UEFA
      Champions League and Europa League matches (themselves sub-licensed from TSN), as well as other international
      sports rights.[11]The Canadian launch was met with technical issues; DAZN apologized for the "inadequate service"
      that it delivered, and stated that it was working to rectify them. However, users still reported problems, including
      inconsistent stream qualities, buffering, and latency between the streams and television broadcasts.[12][13] As a
      result, DAZN began to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket to television providers in October 2017, as had been the case
      before. On 20 November 2017, DAZN acquired Canadian rights to FIBA events.[14]In February 2018, DAZN acquired Canadian
      broadcast rights to the 2018 Commonwealth Games (later sub-licensing portions of the coverage to CBC Sports),[15] and
      subsumed Major League Soccer's digital out-of-market service MLS Live—with live and on-demand streaming of matches
      featuring U.S. teams (matches with Canadian teams will only be available after a 48-hour delay to protect the league's
      main rightsholders TSN and TVA Sports). Roku support was also added that month.[18]On 25 May 2018, DAZN announced that
      it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League, beginning in the 2018–19 season
      and replacing TSN.</dd>
